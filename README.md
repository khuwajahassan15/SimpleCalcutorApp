This is a basic project for beginners, the android calculator app will help us to do various arithmetic calculations. This android application will have a user interface with numbers and arithmetic operations. For the development of this application, we will make use of Android Studio. Let us go through its description about what things the user interface will have:

    It will have the number keys that will be created using buttons
    Another thing would be operators like +, *, /, -, % that are created using buttons too
    Then weâ€™ll have to create two more buttons for the delete and answer buttons
    Then, there will be a screen that will show the number entered by the user and result when they click on answer
    This calculator app would be a one time install; once the user installs it they are always ready to use it
